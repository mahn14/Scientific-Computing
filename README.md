MATH/CS 4414: Issues in Scientific Computing . 
Taught by Pengtao Lin at Virginia Tech

"Theory and techniques of modern computational mathematics, computing environments, computational linear algebra, 
optimization, approximation, parameter identification, finite difference and finite element methods and symbolic computation.
Project-oriented course; modeling and analysis of physical systems using state-of-the-art software and packaged subroutines."
-Course Description from Virginia Tech

Goes over numerical methods for approximating derivative and integrals, function zeroes and intercepts,
interpolation, solving parametric & differential equations, and analyses for error and efficiency in each.

This course is cross-listed as a senior elective for Mathematics, requirement for Applied Math majors, and optional senior 
project course for Computer Science majors. 
I apologize for not posting the actual problems themselves, as I lost access to the portal upon graduation and did not download a copy of the problem document to my local machine.

**DISCLAIMER
Many of the function implementations in this repo was given by Dr Lin before being editted to solve assigned problems
